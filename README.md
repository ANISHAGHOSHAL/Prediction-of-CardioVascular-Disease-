# Prediction-of-CardioVascular-Disease-

In recent times, Heart Disease Prediction is one of the most complicated tasks in medical field and 
here data science plays a crucial role in processing huge amount of data in the field of healthcare.

The main objective of this project is to build a machine learning model for heart disease prediction by implementing various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive 
Bayes, Random Forest etc. 

We have done a comparative study by analyzing the performance of 
different machine learning algorithms. 

In this project, we have deployed the most accurate model in a web application to determine significant risk factors based on clinical data that may lead to heart disease and alert patient in advance.

Heart disease is the one of the most common diseases. The diagnosis of cardiovascular disease is a difficult task i.e., it should be performed precisely and efficiently. The early prognosis of cardiovascular diseases can aid in making decisions on lifestyle changes in high-risk patients and in turn reduce the complications. Thus, we have selected the project, “Prediction of Cardiovascular Disease using Machine Learning Algorithms” which is about prediction of heart disease by processing patient’s dataset to whom we need to predict the chance of occurrence of heart disease.
